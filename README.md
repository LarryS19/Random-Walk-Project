# Random-Walk-Project
## Installation
run `python install -r requirements.txt`

## Background
A random walk is a path created by a series of choices, each of which is left entirely to chance. Random walks have practical applications in several areas of academia such as physics and economics. 

For this case, each step will consist of a randomly chosen set of coordinates (each between -4 and 4). This python program can produce simple to complex random walks by changing the number of points (the default number of points is 10,000). 
Figure 1 below represents a random walk with the default number of points. The beginning starts at the green dot, and the gradient represents the path (from light to dark).

Please see my [blog post](https://larrys19.github.io/2021/05/07/National-Parks.html) for an in-depth overview.
